\section{\large Elevator Spiel} % This should be a 1 minute description of what you do that can be used when on an elevator ride, say

\section{\large Job Market Paper Spiel} % You should aim for this to take about 10 minutes.  You should practice it repeatedly on other students and anyone else who will listen

\section{\large Future Research and Career Aspirations} % Should contain some general statements like "my interests are in micro estimation of structual IO models" and some specific statements "I think my next project after my dissertation is complete will be to prove that Google is, in fact, evil, using theorems from mathematical logic'
